              <h3>Buddish // Zen for the Modern World</h3>
              <p>Buddish is a deck of cards made up of philosophies, tools, perspectives, and practices influenced by Buddhist tradition, made easily digestible, through contemporary context. Vetted by experts in theology, each card comprises a teaching that can help us uncover our best selves in the face of life’s most fierce provocations. Ancient practices have been translated, conceptually and linguistically, into Western contexts. With a card for every week of the year, through a simple, conscious, and enjoyable exercise, this artful deck promotes self- and social-improvement—zen—for the modern world. Product coming soon.</p>

              <h3>Pastrytown, An Other Half Experience // Pulling Pints and Pies</h3>
              <p>An entire day full of the sweetest stouts and tartest sours, Pastrytown was a perfect panacea of craft beer delights. Doughnuts danced and strawberries shimmied into brews from the 36 of the best beer makers in the world. This sweet, sweet day of gluttony is one of Other Half's annual beer festivals that take place right to our backyard, Industry City in Brooklyn. Butter had the privilege of executing Other Half's creative director, Megan Penmann's, vision of this fanciful world onto everything from signage to social media content to print design. Want a taste? Stay tuned for Other Half's next festival, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/green-city-2019-tickets-59299372018/amp"target="_blank">Green City, happening on June 22, 2019.</a></p>
