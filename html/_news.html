              <p>"Brooklyn studio Butter has served up this splendid new identity for Flex Mussels in Manhattan, a family-run restaurant that specialises in the freshest and plumpest mussels, sourced from a Canadian fishing island.</p>
              <p>Prince Edward Island claims to have some of the best seafood in the world and it's also notable for its vibrant colours, marine-inspired architecture, and diverse landscape. Butter drew on this rich history and culture for its new brand.</p>
              <p>"We wanted to capture the roots of the restaurant, which started as a storefront on Prince Edward Island before making its way to Manhattan as the family's 23rd establishment 10 plus years ago," says Cari Sekendur, principal of Butter."</p>

              <h3>AIGA Eye on Design</h3>
              <p><strong>July 26, 2019</strong></p>
              <p>"Consistency is great and all, but so is going totally, unexpectedly wild. Brooklyn’s Butter studio worked with New York brewery Other Half to design labels for its short-run beer collaborations, and they are as fun as they are varied. For a Florida retiree-themed beer, Butter designed a peachy label dotted with dolphins and dentures. A milk stout called Spiritual Nucleus is emblazoned with a trippy, screen saver pattern. Our personal favorite, a golden ale called Gold Bangles, features a glitzy print of glitter and gold rings. In other words, it’s what you would never expect from a beer company."</p>

              <h3>Pastrytown, An Other Half Experience // Pulling Pints and Pies</h3>
              <p>An entire day full of the sweetest stouts and tartest sours, Pastrytown was a perfect panacea of craft beer delights. Doughnuts danced and strawberries shimmied into brews from the 36 of the best beer makers in the world. This sweet, sweet day of gluttony is one of Other Half's annual beer festivals that take place right to our backyard, Industry City in Brooklyn. Butter had the privilege of executing Other Half's creative director, Megan Penmann's, vision of this fanciful world onto everything from signage to social media content to print design.
