              <h3>Flex Mussels // A taste of the Canadian Coast</h3>
              <p>Flex Mussels is a Manhattan restaurant staple serving globally inspired seafood from coast to coast. Flex’s speciality: the freshest, plumpest mussels from Prince Edward Island, cooked in a variety of 23 extraordinary sauces.</p>
              <p>The restaurant has origins in PEI, Canada—a picturesque fishing island notable for its vibrant colors, marine inspired architecture, and diverse landscape. The concept for Flex’s new brand identity is inspired by all things PEI.</p>
              <p>Collateral features whimsical illustrations of characters you’d see fishing and frolocking on PEI beaches, as well as island architecture and natural gems. Geometric compositions inspired by nautical flags and colors found on PEI are interspersed throughout the system. Flex menus are full of surprises, intended to bring a sense of discovery and delight to each guest as they flip through.</p>

              <h3>Other Half Brewing // Crafting Beer Labels and Brews</h3>
              <p>Other Half Brewing was born of a vision to brew New York beer with the effort and thoughtfulness representative of the “Other Half” of the industry. Today, Other Half creates craft beers in Brooklyn while collaborating with other breweries, local and global. Elevating their craft with every partnership, Other Half brings the hopped fruits of their labor back to the Brooklyn taproom. We completed packaging for a select number of Other Half’s short run brews—a limited supply of beers produced in collaboration with partner breweries—building off of Other Half’s quirky, bright, poppy yet minimal, brand. Creating cheeky illustrations, like dolphins and dentures for a Florida retiree-themed brew, and metallic labels for some added tactile pizazz, we designed packaging as unique as their Other Half’s brews. Made for the enjoyment of beer aficionados everywhere.</p>

              <h3>Kettner Coffee Supply // A tattoo-worthy identity</h3>
              <p>Kettner Coffee Supply is Nashville’s newest destination for titillating coffee, sweets, and subversion. Located in the east-end of Nashville, Tennessee, hospitality veteran and founder Hannah Schneider wanted to create a coffee shop unlike any she’d experienced before in quality and aesthetic.</p>
              <p>Butter rose to the challenge of developing an unexpected identity that satisfies Kettner’s appetite for something memorable. We created a risque identity replete with scantily clad illustrations and suggestive statements—tonally minimal with lively expression.</p>
              <p>The system touches key pieces of the Kettner Coffee experience from cheeky coffee cups to a thought-provoking menu and soft serve container, merchandise with illustrative innuendos, and ink on skin—the brand spoke to Schneider so much, she now has a tattoo of one of our illustrations and taglines. The identity creates an experience as tempting as sneaking out for a mid-afternoon coffee or savoring a forbidden treat.</p>

              <h3>France // A Playful Photography Portfolio</h3>
              <p>France Olicard is a Cape Town based fashion editorial photographer with an eye for ethereal, authentic human moments. France sought a new website experience reflective of the boundary-pushing, playful nature of her work. Working with designer Heidi Chisholm, we immerse visitors in France’s photography through full-bleed images on the homepage. A minimalist grid structure was designed to house photos and videography by publication, within her digital portfolio. We brought illustrations to life through front-end animation, creating a flying bird on loading state. Like France’s photography, the site features a few fun Easter eggs; such as, a draggable bird illustration and memorial for Diego (the artist’s beloved bulldog). Our favorite: a 3D virtual image experience on the mobile landing page that captures South Africa’s glory.</p>

              <h3>Alma Mater // A Music Label Modernized</h3>
              <p>Alma Mater Records, formerly “Hot Mom USA,” were in need of brand refresh that would harmonize the label with their ethos. The company wanted to preserve a mention of motherhood in the name through a sentiment more inclusive of the company’s values—feminists, LGBTQIA+ folks, and POC. We renamed the group Alma Mater, meaning “nourishing mother” in Latin. The name gave the brand an elevated image that resonates with youth culture, and stays true to the label’s maternal roots. The lions in the logo were inspired by the the Greek goddess Cybele, who was referred to as “alma mater” during ancient times. Cybele’s lion-drawn chariot would cue wild music and disorderly, ecstatic scenes wherever the goddess would go. We loved this idea of ecstatic disorder and carried it into the rest of the identity, using collage elements, illustration, and bright colors. </p>
