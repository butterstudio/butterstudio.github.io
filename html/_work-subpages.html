            Other Half Brewing was born of a vision to brew New York beer with the effort and thoughtfulness representative of the “Other Half” of the industry. Today, Other Half produces craft beers in Brooklyn while collaborating with other breweries, local and global. Elevating their craft with every partnership, Other Half brings the hopped fruits of their labor back to the Brooklyn taproom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building off of Other Half’s quirky, bright, poppy brand, Butter created packaging for a number of Other Half’s short run brews—a limited supply of beers often produced in collaboration with partner breweries. Short run labels feature playful illustrations like dolphins and dentures for a Florida retiree-themed brew and metallic materials for added tactile pizazz. Our engagement evolved into an ongoing partnership; Butter designs 5+ labels monthly for the brewery as well as materials for Other Half’s bi-annual beer festivals. From packaging to event signage, our goal is always to ladder up to the unexpected nature of Other Half’s beer, creating visual experiences beer aficionados everywhere will enjoy.

            Kettner Coffee Supply is Nashville’s newest destination for titillating coffee, sweets, and subversion. Located in the east-end of Nashville, Tennessee, hospitality veteran and founder Hannah Schneider wanted to create a coffee shop unlike any she’d experienced before in quality and aesthetic. Serving coffee made from the top two percent of the world’s best beans, Kettner prides itself on bringing Nashville premium coffee at an accessible price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Butter rose to the challenge of developing an unexpected identity that satisfies Kettner’s appetite for something memorable and unique. Designing an experience that would resonate with the myriad creatives and young professionals flocking to Nashville, the brand celebrates nuances of Nashvillians, native and new, as well as Kettner’s female-led team. The brand is equal parts feminist, modern, and fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system touches key pieces of the Kettner Coffee experience from cheeky coffee cups to a thought-provoking menu and soft serve container, merchandise with illustrative innuendos, and ink on skin—the brand spoke to Schneider so much, she now has a tattoo of one of our illustrations. The identity creates an experience as tempting as sneaking out for a mid-afternoon coffee or savoring a forbidden treat.

            Alma Mater Records, formerly “Hot Mom USA,” were in need of brand refresh that would harmonize the label with their ethos. The company wanted to preserve a mention of motherhood in the name through a sentiment more inclusive of the company’s values—feminists, LGBTQIA+ folks, and POC. We renamed the group Alma Mater, meaning “nourishing mother” in Latin. The name gave the brand an elevated image that resonates with youth culture, and stays true to the label’s maternal roots. The lions in the logo were inspired by the the Greek goddess Cybele, who was referred to as “alma mater” during ancient times. Cybele’s lion-drawn chariot would cue wild music and disorderly, ecstatic scenes wherever the goddess would go. We loved this idea of ecstatic disorder and carried it into the rest of the identity, using collage elements, illustration, and bright colors.

            Flex Mussels is a Manhattan restaurant staple serving globally inspired seafood from coast to coast. Flex’s speciality: the freshest, plumpest mussels from Prince Edward Island, cooked in a variety of 23 extraordinary sauces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restaurant is a family establishment with origins in PEI, Canada—a picturesque fishing island notable for its vibrant colors, marine inspired architecture, and diverse landscape. The concept for Flex’s new brand identity is inspired by all things PEI. The Flex team wanted to capture the roots of the restaurant, which started as a storefront on PEI before making its way to Manhattan as the family’s 23rd restaurant ten plus years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cheeky quality is carried through the brand, from the illustrations to logos, colors, and taglines. Brand collateral features whimsical illustrations of characters you’d see fishing and frolicking on PEI beaches, as well as island architecture and natural gems. Geometric compositions inspired by nautical flags and colors found on PEI are interspersed throughout the system. Flex menus are full of surprises, intended to bring a sense of discovery and delight to each guest as they flip through. The structure of the menu was thoughtfully considered to maximize ease of use for the restaurant, sustainability, and the guest experience.

            Ark Foods Founder Noah Robins grew up in agriculture, dreaming of veggies. Seeking vegetables in the produce aisle as incredible as those he’d experienced fresh from the farm—and in a quest for the perfect shisito—Noah developed his own pepper and veggie farm, cultivating vegetables for purchase across the United States and Canada under a new brand: Ark Foods. Butter was tasked with bringing Ark Foods’ existing branding into a food packaging aesthetic that would stand apart from the staid sea of consumer packaged goods on the shelf. Butter had the opportunity to do prop styling and art direction alongside extraordinary photographer Jeff Harris and food stylist mastermind Lisa Homa. With the photos of each dish complete, Butter took Ark Food’s established brand and gave it a minimalist revival for application onto the packaging of Ark Foods’ Veggie Bowls—plant-based pastas made from rutabaga ribbons and cauliflower florets. The project was the brand’s first foray into the prepared foods category following years of being solely a raw vegetable distributor. Ark Foods Veggie Bowls are now sold at Whole Foods nationally, as well as other select food marketplaces.

            Buddish is a deck of cards made up of philosophies, tools, and perspectives influenced by Buddhist tradition. It’s contents are Budd-ish. After discovering Buddhism through Dharma Punx—a NYC Buddhist community—Lauren began incorporating its ideologies in her own life. Inspired to share how the practice impacts her outlook, through Buddish, Lauren makes Buddhism accessible, enjoyable, and relevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Led by Lauren’s Buddhist knowledge and creative vision, Butter developed the Buddish name, tone of voice, and incorporated research to write and edit content for the fifty-two-card deck. Bringing scripture to the post-information age, the brand voice balances the profundity of ancient teachings with the absurdity of how we experience and navigate life today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Butter also developed content for the Buddish illustrated guide: a how-to on the various ways to interact with the Buddish deck. Helping with social and advertorial content, newsletters, and other copy needs, we continue to work on the project today. With a card for every week of the year, Buddish is for anyone looking for a fresh perspective that stands the test of time. Through a simple, conscious, tactile exercise, this artful deck promotes self- and social-improvement—zen—for the modern world.

            "Around the world, on the tall grasses of the countryside, on the clay terrains of townships, and on the concrete of cities, they defy – sometimes in spite of themselves – the norms and expectations of gender. They confront prejudice, they affirm themselves, they occupy space. They are women, and they are footballers.
          </p>
          <p>Powerful, quick, technical, eager, free: this is how we, <a href="http://lesdegommeuses.org/" target="_blank"> Les Dégommeuses,</a> imagine footballers. Queer, badass, cute, or whatever – design them as you wish, but remember that this contest intends to highlight their diversity."</p>
          <p>
            This was the brief given by Les Dégommeuses, a queer activist association and soccer team based in Paris, for their Women's World Cup poster competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our poster was selected as part of a series of 13 finalists and in turn was exhibited in galleries in Paris and subsequently across the globe. It was also hung in the center of Paris along the walls of the official Fifa Fan Zone during the Cup as well as wheatpasted across the city by the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were honored to take part in this competition and hope that our work helped to showcase the diversity of women in soccer as well as inspire young girls to pursue their passion for the sport.

            <a href="https://www.flores-exhibits.org/">The Flores Exhibits</a> aims to influence systemic change in US immigration policies through narrative-driven advocacy. The project is composed of a series of videos of artists, lawyers, former judges, activists, and other prominent figures reading sworn testimonies of immigrant children detained at the southern US border.
          </p>
          <p>
            The testimonies were taken in June 2019 by a team of lawyers who work as independent monitors of the detention facilities, detail lengthy stays, ongoing family separations, and dirty, unsafe conditions. Waterwell, a theater company working closely with the lawyers at the Immigrants' Rights Clinic and the Center for Institutional and Social Change at Columbia Law School, was asked to bring higher visibilities to these testimonies with the intention of giving the American public another way to understand the details of how the current immigration policy negatively affects immigrant children, young adults, and young mothers with children.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was created by Waterwell and the Broadway Advocacy Coalition as part of Project Amplify's national campaign to bring visibility to the testimonies of immigrant children and young adults held in detention at the U.S. / Mexico border.
