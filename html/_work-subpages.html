            Kettner Coffee Supply is Nashville’s newest destination for titillating coffee, sweets, and subversion. Located in the east-end of Nashville, Tennessee, hospitality veteran and founder Hannah Schneider wanted to create a coffee shop unlike any she’d experienced before in quality and aesthetic. Serving coffee made from the top two percent of the world’s best beans, Kettner prides itself on bringing Nashville premium coffee at an accessible price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Butter rose to the challenge of developing an unexpected identity that satisfies Kettner’s appetite for something memorable and unique. Designing an experience that would resonate with the myriad creatives and young professionals flocking to Nashville, the brand celebrates nuances of Nashvillians, native and new, as well as Kettner’s female-led team. The brand is equal parts feminist, modern, and fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system touches key pieces of the Kettner Coffee experience from cheeky coffee cups to a thought-provoking menu and soft serve container, merchandise with illustrative innuendos, and ink on skin—the brand spoke to Schneider so much, she now has a tattoo of one of our illustrations. The identity creates an experience as tempting as sneaking out for a mid-afternoon coffee or savoring a forbidden treat.

            Alma Mater Records, formerly “Hot Mom USA,” were in need of brand refresh that would harmonize the label with their ethos. The company wanted to preserve a mention of motherhood in the name through a sentiment more inclusive of the company’s values—feminists, LGBTQIA+ folks, and POC. We renamed the group Alma Mater, meaning “nourishing mother” in Latin. The name gave the brand an elevated image that resonates with youth culture, and stays true to the label’s maternal roots. The lions in the logo were inspired by the the Greek goddess Cybele, who was referred to as “alma mater” during ancient times. Cybele’s lion-drawn chariot would cue wild music and disorderly, ecstatic scenes wherever the goddess would go. We loved this idea of ecstatic disorder and carried it into the rest of the identity, using collage elements, illustration, and bright colors.

          Flex Mussels is a Manhattan restaurant staple serving globally inspired seafood from coast to coast. Flex’s speciality: the freshest, plumpest mussels from Prince Edward Island, cooked in a variety of 23 extraordinary sauces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restaurant is a family establishment with origins in PEI, Canada—a picturesque fishing island notable for its vibrant colors, marine inspired architecture, and diverse landscape. The concept for Flex’s new brand identity is inspired by all things PEI. The Flex team wanted to capture the roots of the restaurant, which started as a storefront on PEI before making its way to Manhattan as the family’s 23rd restaurant ten plus years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cheeky quality is carried through the brand, from the illustrations to logos, colors, and taglines. Collateral features whimsical illustrations of characters you’d see fishing and frolocking on PEI beaches, as well as island architecture and natural gems. Geometric compositions inspired by nautical flags and colors found on PEI are interspersed throughout the system. Flex menus are full of surprises, intended to bring a sense of discovery and delight to each guest as they flip through. The structure of the menu was thoughtfully considered to maximize ease of use for the restaurant, sustainability, and the guest experience.

          Other Half Brewing was born of a vision to brew New York beer with the effort and thoughtfulness representative of the “Other Half” of the industry. Today, Other Half produces craft beers in Brooklyn while collaborating with other breweries, local and global. Elevating their craft with every partnership, Other Half brings the hopped fruits of their labor back to the Brooklyn taproom.

          Building off of Other Half’s quirky, bright, poppy brand, Butter created packaging for a number of Other Half’s short run brews—a limited supply of beers often produced in collaboration with partner breweries. Short run labels feature playful illustrations like dolphins and dentures for a Florida retiree-themed brew and metallic materials for added tactile pizazz. Our engagement evolved into an ongoing partnership; Butter designs 5+ labels monthly for the brewery as well as materials for Other Half’s bi-annual beer festivals. From packaging to event signage, our goal is always to ladder up to the unexpected nature of Other Half’s beer, creating visual experiences beer aficionados everywhere will enjoy.

        Other Half's cans are often kooky and unexpected. Frequently referencing hip hop lyrics or craft-beer-world inside jokes, the brewery never shies away from pushing boundaries.
