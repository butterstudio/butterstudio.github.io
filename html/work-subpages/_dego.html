        "Around the world, on the tall grasses of the countryside, on the clay terrains of townships, and on the concrete of cities, they defy – sometimes in spite of themselves – the norms and expectations of gender. They confront prejudice, they affirm themselves, they occupy space. They are women, and they are footballers.
      </p>
      <p>Powerful, quick, technical, eager, free: this is how we, <a href= "http://lesdegommeuses.org/" target="_blank"> Les Dégommeuses,</a> imagine footballers. Queer, badass, cute, or whatever – design them as you wish, but remember that this contest intends to highlight their diversity."</p>
      <p>
        This was the brief given by Les Dégommeuses, a queer activist association and soccer team based in Paris, for their Women's World Cup poster competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our poster was selected as part of a series of 13 finalists and in turn was exhibited in galleries in Paris and subsequently across the globe. It was also hung in the center of Paris along the walls of the official Fifa Fan Zone during the cup as well as wheatpasted across the city by the team. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We were honored to take part in this competition and hope that our work helped to showcase the diversity of women in soccer as well as inspire young girls to pursue their passion for the sport.
