        Ark Foods Founder Noah Robins grew up in agriculture, dreaming of veggies. Seeking vegetables in the produce aisle as incredible as those he’d experienced fresh from the farm—and in a quest for the perfect shisito—Noah developed his own pepper and veggie farm, cultivating vegetables for purchase across the United States and Canada under a new brand: Ark Foods. Butter was tasked with bringing Ark Foods’ existing branding into a food packaging aesthetic that would stand apart from the staid sea of consumer packaged goods on the shelf. Butter had the opportunity to do prop styling and art direction alongside extraordinary photographer Jeff Harris and food stylist mastermind Lisa Homa. With the photos of each dish complete, Butter took Ark Food’s established brand and gave it a minimalist revival for application onto the packaging of Ark Foods’ Veggie Bowls—plant-based pastas made from rutabaga ribbons and cauliflower florets. The project was the brand’s first foray into the prepared foods category following years of being solely a raw vegetable distributor. Ark Foods Veggie Bowls are now sold at Whole Foods nationally, as well as other select food marketplaces.

      We took Ark Foods established brand identity and pared it back by removing rustic-feeling flourishes to create a more contemporary, minimal overall look.

      We sourced brightly colored, handmade bowls to hold our veggie pastas, giving the front of the package a pop of color to help it stand out on shelf.
