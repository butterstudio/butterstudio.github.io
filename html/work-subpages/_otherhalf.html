         Other Half Brewing was born of a vision to brew New York beer with the effort and thoughtfulness representative of the “Other Half” of the industry. Today, Other Half produces craft beers in Brooklyn while collaborating with other breweries, local and global. Elevating their craft with every partnership, Other Half brings the hopped fruits of their labor back to the Brooklyn taproom. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Building off of Other Half’s quirky, bright, poppy brand, Butter created packaging for a number of Other Half’s short run brews—a limited supply of beers often produced in collaboration with partner breweries. Short run labels feature playful illustrations like dolphins and dentures for a Florida retiree-themed brew and metallic materials for added tactile pizazz. Our engagement evolved into an ongoing partnership; Butter designs 5+ labels monthly for the brewery as well as materials for Other Half’s bi-annual beer festivals. From packaging to event signage, our goal is always to ladder up to the unexpected nature of Other Half’s beer, creating visual experiences beer aficionados everywhere will enjoy.

        Other Half's cans are often kooky and unexpected. Frequently referencing hip hop lyrics or craft-beer-world inside jokes, the brewery never shies away from pushing boundaries.
