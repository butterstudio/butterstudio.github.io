        Kettner Coffee Supply is Nashville’s newest destination for titillating coffee, sweets, and subversion. Located in the east-end of Nashville, Tennessee, hospitality veteran and founder Hannah Schneider wanted to create a coffee shop unlike any she’d experienced before in quality and aesthetic. Serving coffee made from the top two percent of the world’s best beans, Kettner prides itself on bringing Nashville premium coffee at an accessible price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Butter rose to the challenge of developing an unexpected identity that satisfies Kettner’s appetite for something memorable and unique. Designing an experience that would resonate with the myriad creatives and young professionals flocking to Nashville, the brand celebrates nuances of Nashvillians, native and new, as well as Kettner’s female-led team. The brand is equal parts feminist, modern, and fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system touches key pieces of the Kettner Coffee experience from cheeky coffee cups to a thought-provoking menu and soft serve container, merchandise with illustrative innuendos, and ink on skin—the brand spoke to Schneider so much, she now has a tattoo of one of our illustrations. The identity creates an experience as tempting as sneaking out for a mid-afternoon coffee or savoring a forbidden treat.
