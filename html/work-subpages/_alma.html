       Alma Mater Records, formerly “Hot Mom USA,” were in need of brand refresh that would harmonize the label with their ethos. The company wanted to preserve a mention of motherhood in the name through a sentiment more inclusive of the company’s values—feminists, LGBTQIA+ folks, and POC. We renamed the group Alma Mater, meaning “nourishing mother” in Latin. The name gave the brand an elevated image that resonates with youth culture, and stays true to the label’s maternal roots. The lions in the logo were inspired by the the Greek goddess Cybele, who was referred to as “alma mater” during ancient times. Cybele’s lion-drawn chariot would cue wild music and disorderly, ecstatic scenes wherever the goddess would go. We loved this idea of ecstatic disorder and carried it into the rest of the identity, using collage elements, illustration, and bright colors.

      The logo is modular and can be used in it's largest format for maximum impact or one of the subtler formats to suit applications like album covers, where we want the album artwork to shine.
